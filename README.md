# HandGestureControl
This Python project utilizes hand gesture recognition to control a computer interface. It employs the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for translating recognized gestures into computer commands. The camera captures real-time hand movements, enabling users to interact with the computer by performing specific gestures.
